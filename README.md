# Carin Storage Space Calculator
## Project scope
During an internship with TC&C Ltd., this project was developed with the aim of creating a simple and lightweight website serving as a marketing tool. The objective was to facilitate seamless integration into the company's existing website. The main purpose of this tool was to showcase the flexibility of the company's product, demonstrating its ability to adapt to diverse use cases and requirements by supporting a wide range of recording codecs. Through the utilization of this tool, potential customers can gain insights into how their storage needs would be impacted by implementing the company's product.

## Use-case
This website provides a convenient tool for customers to estimate their storage requirements based on their recording preferences and usage patterns.
